Another year has passed again. Some saw good times, while some saw bad times. I know that most have experienced challenging times, and just by saying that, lots of bad memories came back. Bad times are something we usually don't talk about, and they are not easily forgettable. Anyways, let's talk about something else.

You managed to survive this year despite all the things (you already know about those things) that are going on globally, and for that, congratulations. You deserve it. If you think that this year was shorter than the last one, that means you have spent more time on your mobile than doing something else (Sadly, I'm one of those). But that doesn't mean that I didn't do anything hard to achieve my goals this year. I put more effort into achieving my goals, and if you are reading this, that means I'm getting the fruits of my labor.

Talking about hard work, how did your New Year resolutions go? Did you manage to achieve all your goals? I know a lot of us didn't manage to achieve them all, and for those who did, first of all, congratulations. Now, let's come to those like us who didn't manage to achieve them. First of all, stop blaming yourself. I know that you are feeling bad and want to punish yourself a lot, but it's not going to do anything. You will only end up making yourself worse.

We live in a hustle culture, and in this day and age, we can't even get to live a few moments without a random influencer talking about productivity, discipline, goals, motivations, etc., and "how to be productive throughout the entire day." Don't listen to them. Find a few moments of peace and just be yourself. Accept yourself; loving yourself is the only way for you to improve yourself. These influencers are the ones who make you feel like you are nothing and that you are wasting your entire life away. Even if you try to find some peace, you will feel like you are just wasting your life away because your mind has now been programmed to think that even resting a little bit equals wasting life away.

Find some peace, take a rest for a while, think about yourself, and talk to yourself just for a moment, please.

I usually refrain from requesting comments on my posts, but this time, I invite you to share your thoughts openly. However, for this particular post, I'd like to keep the comments focused solely on personal reflections. Feel free to share your experiences throughout the year, the challenging moments when you felt isolated, and the times when you were your own solace. Express discipline, frustration, self-compliments, or make promises to yourself for the future. If you're interested in reading my personal comment, you can continue, or if not, please proceed with your comment on yourself. Additionally, consider posting your reflections on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1hDiyPvrH7/?img_index=1) page for a broader conversation and connection with others.

Dear Me, I know that this year was probably the worst year of your life, and you have made lots of mistakes which I know you are regretting even still today. But don't worry; it's going to be fine. Keep working hard on yourself and chase your goals. Focus on your health and always keep smiling.
