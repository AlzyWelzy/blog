Another year has passed again. Some saw good times, while some saw bad times. I know that most have experienced challenging times, and just by saying that, lots of bad memories came back. Bad times are something we usually don't talk about, and they are not easily forgettable. Anyways, let's talk about something else.

You managed to survive this year despite all the things (you already know about those things) that are going on globally, and for that, congratulations. You deserve it. If you think that this year was shorter than the last one, that means you have spent more time on your mobile than doing something else (Sadly, I'm one of those). But that doesn't mean that I didn't do anything hard to achieve my goals this year. I put more effort into achieving my goals, and if you are reading this, that means I'm getting the fruits of my labor.

Talking about hard work, how did your New Year resolutions go? Did you manage to achieve all your goals? I know a lot of us didn't manage to achieve them all, and for those who did, first of all, congratulations. Now, let's come to those like us who didn't manage to achieve them. First of all, stop blaming yourself. I know that you are feeling bad and want to punish yourself a lot, but it's not going to do anything. You will only end up making yourself worse.

We live in a hustle culture, and in this day and age, we can't even get to live a few moments without a random influencer talking about productivity, discipline, goals, motivations, etc., and "how to be productive throughout the entire day." Don't listen to them. Find a few moments of peace and just be yourself. Accept yourself; loving yourself is the only way for you to improve yourself. These influencers are the ones who make you feel like you are nothing and that you are wasting your entire life away. Even if you try to find some peace, you will feel like you are just wasting your life away because your mind has now been programmed to think that even resting a little bit equals wasting life away.

Find some peace, take a rest for a while, think about yourself, and talk to yourself just for a moment, please.

Hmm, let's do something. Usually, I don't ask anyone to comment on my post, but this time I'm asking you, it's for your honesty. Don't comment about this post, not for others, not even for me; it's just for you and only you. Leave a comment summarizing your entire year, about the times when you were really down, about the times when at night there was only you for you, just you. If possible, discipline yourself; if possible, get angry at yourself; if possible, compliment yourself; if possible, promise yourself for the future. If you want to read my personal comment about me, then you can proceed further, or if not, then please write down your comment about yourself.

Dear Me, I know that this year was probably the worst year of your life, and you have made lots of mistakes which I know you are regretting even still today. But don't worry; it's going to be fine. Keep working hard on yourself and chase your goals. Focus on your health and always keep smiling.
