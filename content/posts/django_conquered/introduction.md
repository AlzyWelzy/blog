## What is Django Conquered?

Introducing my first ever series on this blog. I always wanted to have a blog of my blog and I wanted to provide a way to help others in any way possible so I thought why not I just start a blog of my own and share my knowledge with others.

## Why Django Conquered?

Django is a full-stack production ready framework and it's one of the most powerful framework in existence with tons of batteries included in it. So, if you master it, you'll be able to use it in your own projects and become job ready as well.

## Prerequisites

Things that you need to know before you start:

- Python 3.9+

that's it. You don't need to know all of python to start. If you know variables, loops, functions, etc. you're good to go.

So what are you waiting for, start learning with me and let's conquer Django together.
