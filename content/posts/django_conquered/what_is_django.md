## What is Django?

Django is a web development framework for Python. It is one of the most popular full-stack web development framework for Python. It is a production grade framework with tons of batteries included in it. So, if you master it, you'll be able to use it in your own projects and become job ready as well.

## Django Batteries Included

"Django batteries included" refers to the philosophy of the Django web framework, emphasizing a comprehensive and feature-rich package that comes with a variety of built-in tools and functionalities. This means that Django provides a wide range of components and features out of the box, reducing the need for developers to search for and integrate third-party solutions for common web development tasks.

## Key Features:

1. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** Django includes a powerful ORM that allows developers to interact with the database using Python code, rather than raw SQL queries.

2. **Admin Interface:** Django provides an automatic admin interface for managing database records. Developers can easily create, read, update, and delete records using this built-in feature.

3. **URL Routing:** Django includes a robust URL routing system that makes it easy to map URLs to specific views and functions within your application.

4. **Template Engine:** Django comes with its own template engine that allows developers to separate HTML code from Python code, promoting clean and maintainable code.

5. **Forms:** Django provides a form handling system, making it easy to process and validate user input.

6. **Security Features:** Django includes various security features, such as protection against common web vulnerabilities like CSRF attacks and SQL injection.

7. **Authentication and Authorization:** The framework includes a built-in authentication system with support for user management, login, and password recovery. It also supports fine-grained authorization controls.

8. **Middleware:** Django allows developers to implement middleware components to process requests and responses globally across the entire application.

9. **Static Files Handling:** Django includes tools for managing static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) during development and serving them efficiently in production.

10. **Internationalization and Localization:** Django supports the development of multilingual websites through built-in internationalization and localization features.

11. **Testing Framework:** Django includes a testing framework that makes it easy to write and execute tests for your application.

12. **RESTful API Support:** While not part of the core, Django provides the Django REST framework, which is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
